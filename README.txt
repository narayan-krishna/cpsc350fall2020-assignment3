main.cpp
Makefile
core

Errors/Limitations:
Couldn't figure out how to know if a file didn't exist when the reader
looks for it.
Will find an error if a delimiter exists in a string. Code assumes all
delimiters must be matched, regardless of whether they actually affect
code.

Running the assignment:
*in command line*
make all
./assignment2.exe
